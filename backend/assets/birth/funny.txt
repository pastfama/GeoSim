Because someone's lucky socks finally did their magic
As a result of a spontaneous game of "Truth or Dare" gone wrong (or right?)
Thanks to a romantic weekend getaway that included too much wine and starry skies
Due to a shared love of 90s sitcom reruns and late-night popcorn
Blame it on the irresistible charm of a salsa dancing class instructor
Because someone dared fate by saying, "What are the odds?"
After a spontaneous rendition of "Love Shack" at karaoke night
Because someone's dog played matchmaker at the dog park
Due to an impromptu beach bonfire that ended with more than just s'mores
As a result of a baking competition that got a little too heated in the kitchen
Because someone said, "Let's try something new" at the roller disco
Thanks to a friendly debate over the best pizza topping combination
Your fathers condom broke, and thus
Your mother was very outgoing at a rave and took your father into a port-a-potty,
Your dad rescued your mother from a burning building, and she felt she must repay him.
